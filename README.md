# Write a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor of 2 numbers. 

## Greatest Common Divisor
Given two integers a and b, write a function that returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The GCD of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both of the integers without leaving a remainder.

## Example 1:
Input: a = 56, b = 98
Output: 14
Explanation: The largest integer that divides both 56 and 98 without leaving a remainder is 14.
## Example 2:
Input: a = 48, b = 18
Output: 6
Explanation: The largest integer that divides both 48 and 18 without leaving a remainder is 6.
### Constraints:
0 <= a, b <= 10^9
Both a and b are non-negative integers.
#### Note:
If both a and b are 0, return 0.
#### Function Signature:
java--->
<pre>
public class Solution {
    public int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // your code here
    }
}
</pre>
